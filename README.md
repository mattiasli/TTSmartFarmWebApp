# SmartFarm Remote Web App

React + TypeScript + Vite + Fluent UI v9 dashboard for the existing TT SmartFarm. A persistent Node service owns MQTT and automations. The browser never talks to HiveMQ.

This folder is the application repository (`https://github.com/mattiasli/TTSmartFarmWebApp`). Keep local files here.

## Status

Implementation is in progress. See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`. Live pumping stays disabled until supervised hardware acceptance.

## Layout

- `apps/dashboard` — federation host
- `apps/automations-remote` — federated automation editor
- `apps/api` — Fastify API, WebSocket, MQTT controller
- `packages/contracts` — runtime schemas
- `packages/domain` — protocol and automation rules
- `packages/ui` — Fluent theme
- `tools/simulator` — firmware-shaped simulator

## Quick start

```text
npm ci
npm run test:unit
npm run build
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` stays running. Open http://127.0.0.1:5173 when it prints that the servers are ready. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

Details: `docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`.
